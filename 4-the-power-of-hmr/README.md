## Run the project
- run `npm i` to install the dependencies
- run `npm run hot` to start the packager
- open the project into `ios/` with **xcode** and then run the project into your favorite device !
- make sure to have Chrome Debugger enabled (in the simulator `ctrl + cmd + z` -> `enable Chrome debugging`)
